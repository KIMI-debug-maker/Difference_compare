about clasp

founded almost 50 years ago in washington, d.c., the center for law and social policy (clasp) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, anti-poverty organization advancing federal, state, and local policy solutions for low-income people. we advocate for public policies and programs at the federal, state, and local levels that reduce poverty, improve low-income peoples lives, and create ladders to economic security. we use a racial equity framework, developing solutions that address racial, ethnic, income, and immigration status barriers.

threats to low-income people are greater ever than at any time in clasps history. our work is more important, urgent, and in demand than ever. we are a growing organization that brings a distinguished history and the capacity for innovation and change. in that dynamic context, we are seeking a deeply committed, strategic, and creative leader with a respectful, collaborative management style to direct clasps center for postsecondary and economic success (c-pes), our policy team for workforce development and postsecondary education.

across decades, we have kept our vision alive in a wide range of political and policy contexts by providing trusted expertise, a deeply knowledgeable staff, and a commitment to practical yet forward-looking approaches to achieving opportunity for all. we lift up the voices of poor and low-income children, families, and individuals, equip advocates with strategies that work, and help public officials put good ideas into practice.

within this broad anti-poverty mission, clasp is organized around five policy teams: child care and early education, youth policy, center for postsecondary and economic success, income and work supports, and job quality. over the past several years, we have integrated our work more extensively across teams, providing depth on crosscutting issues like immigration and immigrant families, criminal justice reform, and mental health.

about c-pes

in 2010, clasp launched the center for postsecondary and economic success (c-pes) to complement our long-standing commitment to workforce development and basic skills development for low-income adults and youth with limited skills and barriers to employment. this includes a strong focus on postsecondary access and success. recently, this expanded to include justice reform work.

this team plays an important bridging role, improving alignment between postsecondary education, workforce development, and adult education. c-pes also works closely with other clasp teams to offer deep expertise on the connections between basic needs programs (e.g., medicaid, snap, child care) and education and workforce systems.

recognizing that federal, state, and local/institutional work is mutually reinforcing, c-pes works across levels of government. our federal policy work is informed by our technical assistance to states and local areas/institutions. and our ability to provide technical assistance is enhanced by our knowledge of the intricacies of federal policy.

position summary

our ideal candidate brings significant leadership experience and a broad knowledge of c-pes policy areas. s/he is a recognized expert in one or more of these fields. the successful candidate will have the ability to strategically leverage a diverse team of experts in postsecondary education, workforce development, and adult education (currently 8 members) as well as creatively partner with experts from our income and work supports, youth, child care, and job quality teams. the successful candidate will also bring passion for clasps anti-poverty and racial equity mission and strong relationships with key external partners and stakeholders.

key responsibilities

* strategic leadership and vision: develop, articulate, and implement a strategic vision for the c-pes team in partnership with team members as well as clasp colleagues. this will be achieved in the context of clasps organizational mission and the rapidly changing policy and budget environment.
* inclusive supervision and effective team building: encourage team collaboration, professional development, and input from all team members, including remote staff; communicate effectively and listen actively, with a respect for diverse perspectives and healthy team debate; provide thought leadership and support in the design of advocacy strategies; leverage the expertise and deep knowledge base of a team of experts; and continue to forge connections between this team and others at clasp.
* communications, technical assistance, and external engagement:continue to strengthen clasps role as a strong voice for lower-skilled, low-income adults and youth in workforce and postsecondary policy; strengthen our ability to effectively frame and communicate the importance of these issues; speak directly to our vision and practical next steps through speaking, writing, and direct partnership with policymakers, advocates, and other stakeholders.
* fundraising and funder relations: lead the teams fundraising efforts and effectively engage with funders.
* clasp-wide leadership and collaboration:  participate with clasp colleagues in strategic thinking about: 1) opportunities and risks for low-income people, people of color, and immigrants in setting priorities for clasps work as a whole; and 2) in creating an organization-wide atmosphere that supports clasps values of diversity, inclusion, and effectiveness.

ideal qualifications

* demonstrated commitment to improving the circumstances of vulnerable and low-income people, immigrants, and communities of color.
* leadership experience in at least one of the areas addressed by c-pes (postsecondary education, workforce development, or adult education), including a proven ability to develop, articulate, and execute a vision and lead a staff of policy experts.
* deep understanding of policy and practice in at least one of these areas. this could have been gained, for example, through substantial experience in a public-sector policymaking role, in a nonprofit advocacy organization, as a legislative staffer, through leadership on these issues with an employer, or several of the above. ideally, this experience will include knowledge of both policy and practice spanning multiple levels of government (federal, state, and local) as well as an understanding of the community, policy, operational, and political context for the issues.
* in addition to depth in at least one c-pes area, the successful candidate should have some familiarity with the others. ideally, this will include experience in advocacy, policy, or implementation relevant to building connections across the areas.
* strong reputation and visibility in the field; strong communicator, including experience successfully interacting with news media as a content expert and proven ability to write and speak to a variety of audiences; ability to distill the technical details of public policy into language that is easily accessible to wider audiences.
* demonstrated capacity to supervise and mentor both junior and senior staff, with a respectful and collaborative management style, and demonstrated capacity to build a highly effective and mutually supportive team.
* proven ability to identify and develop innovative policies and/or practices; creative; and entrepreneurial.
* demonstrated capacity to bring a racial equity lens to policy development and implementation.
* strong project management skills; demonstrated ability to effectively manage multiple initiatives from multiple funders; and experience overseeing grant and contract deliverables.
* demonstrated success in fundraising as well as developing and managing funder relationships.
* successful record of initiating and cultivating relationships with partners, both mainstream and nontraditional; and proven ability to collaborate.
* advanced degree in relevant field, such as masters or j.d., is required.

"manager - research & insights
schireson - seattle, wa

about the firm

for about 100 years, the research business has been chugging along in pretty much the same way, doing the same things in the same predictable ways, using the same aging methods and tools, somehow out of sync with a marketplace thats changing at warp speed. clearly, theres a need for something different.

schireson associates is that something. born in and of the digital information revolution, schireson was conceived to change the way we make decisions. today, we are a boutique research & strategy consulting firm. for more than 20 years, we have been delivering highly differentiated research and marketing consulting services to a growing community of clients. we endeavor to make research more than an academic exercise that lives in boring presentations. we partner with clients to ask and answer the most strategic and complex business questions through customized, sophisticated quantitative and qualitative analysis. our clients are market leaders from a wide range of industries, such as media & entertainment, technology, automotive, financial services, cosmetics and packaged goods. we have deep, on-going relationships with our clients and work to deliver the best possible insights and the highest level of satisfaction.

our academic backgrounds are varied: from phds to bas; from ivy league to state schools. many of us have professional roots in high tech, and our collective previous experience spans music, military service, entrepreneurship, market research, venture capital, investment banking and management consulting.

our company is growing rapidly, and we are looking for exceptional people to join us.

about you: your work experience and interests

we are looking to fill a very specific need. as such, we seek someone with very precise background and set of skills that involves strategy, consulting, and/or product. if the following doesnt describe you, please take a look at one of our other job openings. you must have at least one of the following backgrounds for this position:

* 2+ years in a client facing role at a boutique strategy or design consultancy (e.g., ideo, frog design, etc.)
* 2+ years in a client facing role at a top strategy or consulting company (e.g., mckinsey, strategy&, etc.)
* 2+ years at technology companies (startup or established) in a product or strategy role
* 2+ years at an ad agency (e.g., mccann, droga5, etc) in a strategy role
you must also have demonstrated expertise with enterprise information technology and commercial / b2b technology offerings.

we also anticipate that you have:

* 5 to 8 years of work experience
* an mba with an emphasis in marketing, strategy, business management or similar from a top school
* familiarity and/or direct experience with primary research and/or consulting
* proven examples of the ability to successfully manage multiple projects with diverse stakeholders and hard deadlines to completion, on time and at a high level of quality, with minimal guidance and direction.
* a high degree of facility in interpreting complex, ambiguous concepts and distilling them into crisp learnings and insights.
* an aptitude for presenting amorphous, qualitative findings in visually appealing formats
* an extremely high level of proficiency with microsoft office (word, power point, excel)
* a strong work ethic. you will often work with limited supervision and will always be expected to deliver exceptional work
* comfort with and confidence in communicating with client stakeholders at a variety of levels, directly in person, on calls and over email.
* a desire and ability to travel both domestically and internationally at least 50% of the time
some other skills that would be useful:

* great storytelling skills
* a passion for creating compelling ways to visualize information
* experience conducting original research
your role and responsibilities

qualitative research and consulting: as a member of the team that conducts primary and secondary research and engages with our technology clients to synthesize and interpret the **results**, you will be responsible for key parts of our service delivery doing some or all of the following:

* drive the creation of screening documents and discussion guides for focus groups and interviews
* execute qualitative fieldwork and directly engage respondents in structured conversations to understand their needs and opinions
* ensure that our clients derive compelling insights from our fieldwork, both in the back-room of the focus groups and through the reports and presentations that you will write
* create amazing, thoughtful and clear presentations for our clients and then help deliver them
* dig into market data to design and interpret custom research that builds on both our fieldwork and other, secondary research
* work on strategic consulting projects with significant client interaction
business & firm development: at a small firm like schireson, everyone plays a role in growing the business and helping us build a world-class firm. you will help by:

* maintaining strong relationships with your clients
* differentiating schireson on the quality of our insights and the experience of working with us
* help to scope and build compelling proposals for potential new projects
* ensure that every deliverable wows our clients; including pitching in on projects that you arent assigned to on a day-to-day basis
whats important to us (and, ideally, to you)

quality: on the get it right versus get it done scale, we skew more towards get it right. wed rather do something 98% right as opposed to getting it 60% right in much less time. but we work under time constraints, so you shouldnt be afraid of pressure to get things right and on-time.

curiosity and intellectual chops: people at schireson are smart and intellectually curious. you will find yourself in conversations about music, geo-political events and the best place to get tacos on the road from san francisco to fresno. but we also talk about our favorite excel functions with a nerdy glee, read white papers on the best way to ask questions on a likert scale (and debate them), and well plug away until we find the best way to synthesize 100 charts into one powerful picture. some of us compete in data mining competitions for fun. we like learning new techniques and would love for you to teach us some new tricks.

personality: this isnt a typical corporate environment and people looking for a big-firm experience should keep on looking. our offices are very casual and we give our employees virtually unlimited flexibility in scheduling their work. but you should be able to handle that and thrive with the freedom. and everyone at schireson has a pretty interesting life outside of work; we expect you to, as well. being well rounded is important because one of our most important recruiting considerations is whether or not we would each be happy getting stuck somewhere with you.
