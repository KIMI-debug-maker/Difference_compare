team with national luxury homes listing leader al lewis to break-into and sustain listing and sales success at the ""top"" of the market as either an associate or independent-affiliate of real estate professionals world enterprise marketing to list and sell (1) multi-million dollar custom homes (2) estates and (3) resort-oriented residences at any price-point and earn fees from 6% to 8% on each (no discounting).

we do not chase reos, short sales, nods or loan mods, nor do we chase court sales of any type or seek discount-oriented buyers; instead we seek high quality equity-positioned sellers (listings) at the top or high-end of the market, qualified high-end buyers and quick closings.

allstate luxury home sales / non-local, unbounded listing at the ""top"" or high-end of the market is a sure-fast way to grow your status and wealth through real estate. working at arm's length with broker al lewis in the field, in houses, listing in the high-end you will come to know firsthand by observation -- and the doing -- an easier, more pleasurable, more efficient way of getting and doing business at the top while, even, continuing your present work. the ""traditional"" broker/agent associate-licensee relationship is optional, but not required. an opportunity for ""affiliation"" while continuing to work independently or within a current broker/agent association is provided.

an individual, team or whole company can work with broker al lewis under broker's unique umbrella for cooperative listing at the top of the market -- the real estate fellowship -- and have new listings within thirty-days. leads, access, break-in strategies, portfolio, in-field/in-house support, and high-level marketing of homes listed (at broker's expense) provided.

go to www.therealestatefellowship.com for information.

""the idea behind the fellowship is that it is a two person (you and i) team-oriented apprenticeship to a work for both brokers and agents (known as marketing partners and/or protégés) and a retooling platform for lions and tigers, panthers and cheetahs (whether brokers or agents) that by cause or circumstance are not in an effective listing program at this time or, specifically, not geared up for professional high-end sales and marketing to the degree they would like to be."" al lewis

qualifications

to qualify for a quality assurance specialist your resume and supporting documentation must support:

a. specialized experience: one year of specialized experience that equipped you with the particular competencies to successfully perform the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the position to be filled. to qualify at the gs-09 level, applicants must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the gs-07 level or equivalent under other pay systems in the federal service, military or private sector. to qualify at the gs-11 level, applicants must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the gs-09 level or equivalent under other pay systems in the federal service, military or private sector. creditable specialized experience includes:

gs-09:
* applying established techniques, regulations and requirements related to a quality assurance functional program to a variety of assignments.
* interpreting, explaining, and applying technical requirements and specifications to quality assurance problems.
* developing, analyzing, and evaluating facts relative to unsatisfactory conditions or trends and preparing reports to document findings.
* assisting in developing product assurance plans designed to insure effective control of product quality.
* reviewing the contractor's production activities and capabilities in light of contract quality requirements.
gs-11:
* reviewing production activities/capabilities for compliance to contract quality requirements.

* analyzing technical and quality data to detect unsatisfactory trends or weaknesses in material quality.
* verifying by test or inspection, using sampling inspection or intensive product inspection techniques, that products comply with requirements prior to acceptance.
* computing data, summarizing **results**, and preparing reports or charts depicting pertinent relationships using statistical methods.

b. education substitution: such education must demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work. education must be from a college or university accredited by an organization approved by the u.s. department of education. see http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/search.aspx. if using education to meet basic qualifications, you must submit a transcript as supplemental documentation. to qualify based on education in lieu of specialized experience, you must possess:

gs-09:
* master's or equivalent graduate degree or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree or ll.b. or j.d., if related.
gs-11:
* ph.d. or equivalent doctoral degree or 3 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree or ll.m., if related.
c. combination: combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience may be used to meet total qualification requirements for grade levels gs-09 and gs-11, and may be computed by first determining the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; then determining the applicant's education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; and then adding the two percentages. the total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for that grade level. only graduate education in excess of the amount required for the next lower grade level may be used to qualify applicants for positions at grade gs-09 and gs-11.

experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through national service programs (e.g., peace corps, americorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual; community, student, social). volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment. you will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience.

education

are you using your education to qualify? you must provide transcripts or other documentation to support your educational claims. unless otherwise stated: unofficial transcripts are acceptable at time of application.

graduate education: one academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credits hours that your graduate school has determined to represent one academic year of full-time study. such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis. if you cannot obtain your graduate school's definition of one year of graduate study, 18 semester hours (or 27 quarter hours) should be considered as satisfying the requirement for one year of full-time graduate study.

foreign education: if you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show that the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited u.s. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a u.s. accredited college or university.

education

education substitution for the gs-07: 1 year of graduate-level education or superior academic achievement.

superior academic achievement (s.a.a.) is based on (1) class standing, (2) grade-point average, or (3) honor society membership.

class standing -- applicants must be in the upper third of the graduating class in the college, university, or major subdivision, such as the college of liberal arts or the school of business administration, based on completed courses.
grade-point average (g.p.a.)-- applicants must have a grade-point average of:

3.0 or higher out of a possible 4.0 (""b"" or better) as recorded on their official transcript, or as computed based on 4 years of education, or as computed based on courses completed during the final 2 years of the curriculum; or
3.5 or higher out of a possible 4.0 (""b+"" or better) based on the average of the required courses completed in the major field or the required courses in the major field completed during the final 2 years of the curriculum.

grade-point averages are to be rounded to one decimal place. for example, 2.95 will round to 3.0 and 2.94 will round to 2.9.

g.p.a. excluding pass/fail courses. applicants usually cannot claim credit based on their overall g.p.a. if more than 10 percent of their total credit was based on pass/fail or similar systems rather than on traditional grading systems. however, if they can document that only their freshman-year courses (25 percent or less of their total credit) were credited on a pass/fail or similar system, they can use their overall g.p.a. to claim superior academic achievement. if 10 percent or fewer credits or only freshman-year courses were based on pass/fail or similar systems, such credits can be ignored and the g.p.a. computed on the graded courses. applicants can, however, still claim credit based on their last 2 years if 10 percent or fewer credits were based on pass/fail or similar systems. applicants who cannot claim credit under the g.p.a. requirements may claim credit for superior academic achievement only on the basis of class standing or honor society membership.

election to membership in a national scholastic honor society -- applicants can be considered eligible based on membership in one of the national scholastic honor societies listed below. these honor societies are listed by the association of college honor societies. membership in a freshman honor society cannot be used to meet the requirements of this provision.

foreign education: if you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show that the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited u.s. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a u.s. accredited college or university. for more information about this requirement, please visit the u.s. department of education website for foreign education evaluation .

professional registration or licensure -- current registration as an engineer intern (ei), engineer in training (eit), or licensure as a professional engineer (pe) by any state, the district of columbia, guam, or puerto rico. absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., state grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. for example, an applicant who attains registration through a state board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.

written test -- evidence of having successfully passed the fundamentals of engineering (fe) examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various states, the district of columbia, guam, and puerto rico.

specified academic courses -- successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph a. the courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program as described in paragraph a.

related curriculum -- successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance.

note: you must provide a letter of reference stating that you have at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. the letter must be signed by the engineer who provided the professional engineer supervision. it must also include their name, phone number, and engineer credentials (i.e. engineer education or professional certificates). lack of this documentation will make you ineligible to be referred.

note: an applicant who meets the basic requirements as specified in a or b above, except as noted under b.1., may qualify for positions in any branch of engineering unless selective factors indicate otherwise.

note: a sf-50 reflecting that you currently or formerly served as an engineer for the federal government is not qualifying supporting documentation for the basic requirement. you must submit either your transcripts, current registration as a professional engineer, eit examination **results**, and/or supporting documentation based on your claim of the basic requirement, as applicable. lack of this documentation will make you ineligible to be referred.

* fair & transparent

fair & transparent

the federal hiring process is setup to be fair and transparent. please read the following guidance.

equal employment opportunity policy

the united states government does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor.

* equal employment opportunity (eeo) for federal employees & job applicants

reasonable accommodation policy

federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodation to applicants with disabilities where appropriate. applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application process should follow the instructions in the job opportunity announcement. for any part of the remaining hiring process, applicants should contact the hiring agency directly. determinations on requests for reasonable accommodation will be made on a case-by-case basis.

a reasonable accommodation is any change to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job duties or receive equal access to job benefits.

under the rehabilitation act of 1973, federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations when:

* an applicant with a disability needs an accommodation to have an equal opportunity to apply for a job.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential job duties or to gain access to the workplace.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.

you can request a reasonable accommodation at any time during the application or hiring process or while on the job. requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.

learn more about disability employment and reasonable accommodations or how to contact an agency.

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

you will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

if you meet the minimum qualifications, you may be invited to take a computer based test (cbt) to confirm english language proficiency and evaluate x-ray interpretation aptitude. upon passing the cbt, you will be eligible to be scheduled for additional assessments, which include: (1) a structured interview to determine, among other qualities, your decision making skill and your ability to work with teams and the general public; (2) a drug screening; and, (3) a job related medical evaluation that includes a color vision test, vision exam, hearing exam, and adequate joint mobility exam (in part to determine the physical potential to repeatedly lift and/or carry up to 50 pounds, to stand for prolonged periods (e.g. 3-4 hours) of time without a break, and to walk up to three miles during a shift). upon passing these assessments, you will be subject to a pre-hire background investigation. based upon passing the pre-hire background investigation and a qualitative evaluation of the criteria above, you will be placed in one of the following categories:

best qualified: applicants demonstrating a superior level of all evaluation criteria.

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

you will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

if you meet the minimum qualifications, you may be invited to take a computer based test (cbt) to confirm english language proficiency and evaluate x-ray interpretation aptitude. upon passing the cbt, you will be eligible to be scheduled for additional assessments, which include: (1) a structured interview to determine, among other qualities, your decision making skill and your ability to work with teams and the general public; (2) a drug screening; and, (3) a job related medical evaluation that includes a color vision test, vision exam, hearing exam, and adequate joint mobility exam (in part to determine the physical potential to repeatedly lift and/or carry up to 50 pounds, to stand for prolonged periods (e.g. 3-4 hours) of time without a break, and to walk up to three miles during a shift). upon passing these assessments, you will be subject to a pre-hire background investigation. based upon passing the pre-hire background investigation and a qualitative evaluation of the criteria above, you will be placed in one of the following categories:

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodation to applicants with disabilities where appropriate. applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application process should follow the instructions in the job opportunity announcement. for any part of the remaining hiring process, applicants should contact the hiring agency directly. determinations on requests for reasonable accommodation will be made on a case-by-case basis.

a reasonable accommodation is any change to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job duties or receive equal access to job benefits.

under the rehabilitation act of 1973, federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations when:

* an applicant with a disability needs an accommodation to have an equal opportunity to apply for a job.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential job duties or to gain access to the workplace.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.

you can request a reasonable accommodation at any time during the application or hiring process or while on the job. requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

you will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

if you meet the minimum qualifications, you may be invited to take a computer based test (cbt) to confirm english language proficiency and evaluate x-ray interpretation aptitude. upon passing the cbt, you will be eligible to be scheduled for additional assessments, which include: (1) a structured interview to determine, among other qualities, your decision making skill and your ability to work with teams and the general public; (2) a drug screening; and, (3) a job related medical evaluation that includes a color vision test, vision exam, hearing exam, and adequate joint mobility exam (in part to determine the physical potential to repeatedly lift and/or carry up to 50 pounds, to stand for prolonged periods (e.g. 3-4 hours) of time without a break, and to walk up to three miles during a shift). upon passing these assessments, you will be subject to a pre-hire background investigation. based upon passing the pre-hire background investigation and a qualitative evaluation of the criteria above, you will be placed in one of the following categories:

best qualified: applicants demonstrating a superior level of all evaluation criteria.
highly qualified: applicants demonstrating a more than satisfactory level of the evaluation criteria.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

you will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

additional information

no moving, relocation or pre-employment travel expenses will be paid for this position, or while in application for this position.

this position is not a law enforcement position and therefore, is not covered by law enforcement availability pay or law enforcement retirement. per the president's 2014 fair employment memo, tsa policy is to not adversely consider a candidate based on unemployment or financial difficulty through no fault of their own.

tsa is an excepted service agency. employment with tsa does not confer the ""competitive status"" that generally **results** from selection and service in competitive service agencies. however, permanent employees who have at least one year of continuous service with tsa will be eligible to apply for positions in other federal agencies under the opm-dhs interchange agreement.

reasonable accommodation: applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the tsa hraccess help desk at 1-877-872-7990 or tty 1-877-872-7992.

bargaining unit status: this position is in the bargaining unit for which the american federation of government employees (afge) is the exclusive representative.

reemployed annuitants: since the tso position is permanent, it does not meet the eligibility requirement for a salary offset waiver under the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2010. therefore, former federal or postal service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the federal government.

tso dress and appearance responsibilities: tsos are required to adhere to the personal appearance standard that requires a neat, clean and professional appearance while on duty or while wearing a uniform. this includes adherence to policies on accessories and grooming. for example, with the exception of 1/4 inch stud-type earrings, body and/or tongue piercing may not be visible to the public. in addition, tattoos must be covered at all times and not visible to the public (visible tattoos are defined as those present on the body anywhere outside of the standard long-sleeved tso uniform). each airport's federal security director has the discretion whether to permit exceptions and allow visible tattoos to be covered by an acceptable band or skin-colored make-up that does not detract from the tso uniform.

work schedules for part-time positions: specific work shifts and schedules will be determined by the airport.

* part-time shifts generally range from 16-32 hours per week
* part-time work consists of shift-work on any day from sunday through saturday, which may include irregular hours, nights, holidays, overtime, extended shifts and weekend shifts, changing shifts, and split shifts
* a ""split-shift"" consists of any two work shifts, each lasting at least two (2) hours in one 24-hour period, with at least two (2) hours between work shifts
maintaining employment: all tsos must maintain the standard level of certification and fitness for duty, to include:

* completing classroom training, on-the-job training, and all initial certification testing
* recurrent and specialized training and recertification tests on a periodic basis
* passing background investigations, including a criminal check and credit check, and all randomly administered drug and alcohol screening tests

how you will be evaluated

you will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.
